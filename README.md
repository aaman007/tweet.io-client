## Installation and Setup

### Installing Packages
``` npm install ```

### Running the application
``` npm start ```           
   
Application would be accessible on 
<a href="http://localhost:3000"> http://localhost:3000 </a>        
To use the application, registration is required. An api call to the        
backend server is needed for register. Which is why backend server      
also should be live on <a href="http://localhost:8000"> http://localhost:8000 </a>           
The server address could be configured by changing the BASE_URL on        
```/src/constants/index.js``` file
